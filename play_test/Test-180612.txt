Level2 | Player: Mangala

* Re-starting at bucket-0 with single element is boring
** Replay bucket-0 only if element count > 2
** Load failed items, with next set

* Changing bucket instantly is too intense
** Have a pause between bucket changing with reward

* bucket-1 and bucket-2 doesn't feel much different
** Increase set count of bucket-2
